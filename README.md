Source code for paper "[Truth-Aware Context Selection: Mitigating the Hallucinations of Large Language Models Being Misled by Untruthful Contexts]()".

**Truth-Aware Context Selection (TACS)** is a method of selecting context based on its truthfulness, which discards the unreal parts of the context and retains the truthful parts, protecting the LLMs from being misled by untruthful context, thus avoiding the generation of hallucinations. TACS first performs truth detection on the context, and then constructs the corresponding attention mask according to the truthfulness of each position to filter the context. 

> [!Note]
> Experimental results shows that TACS can significantly alleviate the hallucination caused by untruthful context and improve the LLMs' adaptability in the face of information interference. More information can be found in the [paper]().

We provide trained classifiers for truth detection! 

**TruthfulQA Truth Detection Classifiers**: [Classifiers for Llama 2-Chat-7B](https://). [Classifiers for Honest Llama](https://).

**ConflictQA Truth Detection Classifiers**: [Classifiers for Llama 2-Chat-7B](https://).

With these classifiers, TACS can perform truth (hallucination) detection on the contextual information based on the internal representations, evaluating the truthfulness of each location.

## Installation

- Clone TACS's repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ictnlp/TACS.git
cd TACS
export ROOT=pwd
```

- Environment requirements: Python 3.9, Pytorch 1.13.1.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Starts

- **GUI interaction**: We provide a GUI interface to intuitively compare the effect of TACS on LLM. You can click on the examples at the bottom of the page to quickly fill in the 'Question' and 'Information'. After clicking the 'Submit' button, you will see the results of the truth detection on the right, and get the results generated without (left-bottom) or using (right-bottom) TACS respectively.

> [!Tip]
> You can switch the truth detection granularity and adjust the classification threshold. Positions with scores above the threshold will be considered truthful.


To interact with TACS in your browser, you should firstly download the [truth detection classifiers] and place them at $ROOT/tfqa/svm, and then run the following command:

```bash
cd $ROOT/webui
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python webui.py\
    --model_name ${path_to_Llama-2-7b-chat}\
    --token_svm_path ${path_to_token_level_classifier}\
    --token_svm_acc ${path_to_token_level_classifier_acc}\
    --sentence_svm_path ${path_to_sentence_level_classifier}\
    --sentence_svm_acc ${path_to_sentence_level_classifier_acc}\
    --TACS_mode 'DEMO_token'
```
